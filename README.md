# Number-Guessing-Game
## Final Project for the freeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification

Using a shell script and postgres database, I created a number guessing game.
It generates a random number, checks and updates user data, responds to inputs, keeps track of a guess count, and records if it is their best game. 
I used conditional statements to make the program run correctly and to query the database.
I used git and bash terminal commands that I have been learning in this fcc unit to troubleshoot, branch and version control the project.
